# ChiSquare-AnnovaAnalysis
 The project uses Chi-Square and ANOVA in R to assess hypotheses across scenarios like blood type distribution and airline performance. It applies statistical tests to explore relationships and patterns, yielding insights into data significance.

The project delves into statistical analyses using Chi-Square and ANOVA tests to examine various hypotheses across different scenarios, such as the distribution of blood types in a population, on-time performance of airlines, the relationship between ethnicity and movie admissions, women's representation in the military, sodium content in foods, sales of leading companies, per-pupil expenditures, and factors influencing plant growth. Utilizing R programming, the project assesses hypotheses to determine statistical significances and relationships by calculating critical values, test values, and making decisions based on p-values compared to predetermined significance levels (alpha). These analyses help in understanding if observed differences or relationships in data are statistically significant, thereby providing evidence to accept or reject the initial hypotheses.

For instance, the project finds that the distribution of blood types and the relationship between military rank and branch show no significant deviation from expectations, suggesting that observed patterns reflect those of the general population or there is no strong relationship between the variables considered. Conversely, analyses on airline on-time performance, ethnicity's impact on movie attendance, and sales among companies indicate significant differences from the null hypotheses, suggesting that these aspects are influenced by underlying factors. The project's input comprises data sets related to each scenario, and the output includes decisions on each hypothesis based on statistical analysis, offering insights into each domain's dynamics. Through rigorous statistical methods, the project aims to elucidate patterns and relationships within various contexts, providing a foundation for informed decision-making and further research.
